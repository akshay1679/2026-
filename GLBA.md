## Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA).

The **Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA)** is a U.S. federal law passed in **1999** that governs how **financial institutions handle customers’ personal information**.

Here’s the plain-English breakdown:

### What GLBA does

GLBA has **three main parts**:

1. **Financial Privacy Rule**
    
    - Requires banks, lenders, insurance companies, etc. to **explain what customer data they collect and share**
        
    - Customers must be given the **right to opt out** of certain data sharing with non-affiliated third parties
        
2. **Safeguards Rule**
    
    - Requires financial institutions to **protect sensitive customer information**
        
    - They must have a **written security program** (administrative, technical, and physical safeguards)
        
3. **Pretexting Provisions**
    
    - Makes it illegal to obtain customer information through **fraud or impersonation** (aka social engineering)
