Ahh got it — **M-of-N**, that clears it up 👍

**M-of-N voting** (also written **M/N** or **M-out-of-N**) is a **threshold voting system**.

### What it means

- There are **N total voters / authorities**
    
- A proposal (like modifying a resource) is approved **only if at least M of them agree**
    
- Where **M ≤ N**
    

### In plain terms

> “Out of N people who _can_ approve this change, at least M must say yes.”

### How it’s used to modify a resource

M-of-N is commonly used when you want **shared control** over something important:

- **System configuration**
    
- **Blockchain smart contracts / multisig wallets**
    
- **Access to files or infrastructure**
    
- **DAO or governance changes**
    

Example:

- **3-of-5** system admins must approve before:
    
    - updating a database schema
        
    - changing a smart contract
        
    - reallocating funds
        
- No single person can act alone → **safer, less abuse**
    

### Why people use M-of-N

✅ Prevents unilateral changes  
✅ Tolerates failures (some voters can be offline)  
✅ Balances security vs. flexibility

### Typical values

- **1-of-N** → very fast, very risky
    
- **Majority** (⌈N/2⌉-of-N) → democratic
    
- **Supermajority** (e.g. 2/3-of-N) → high security
    
- **N-of-N** → everyone must agree (very strict)
    

### One-sentence summary

**M-of-N voting allows a resource to be modified only when at least M out of N authorized parties approve the change.**

If you want, tell me **where you’re using it** (blockchain, distributed systems, class notes, exam prep), and I can tailor the explanation or give diagrams / examples.
