Location-based access control (LBAC) is a security method that **decides whether someone can access a system, app, or data based on their physical or network location**.

In simple terms:  
👉 _Where you are_ affects _what you’re allowed to do_.

### Simple example

A company has an internal website.

**Rule:**

- Employees can log in **only when they are in the office**
**How it works:**

- If you log in from the **office Wi-Fi** → ✅ access allowed
- If you try to log in from **home or a café** → ❌ access denie

That’s location-based access control.
