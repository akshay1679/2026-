A **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack** is a type of cyberattack where an attacker secretly sits **between two parties who think they’re communicating directly**, and **intercepts, reads, or alters** the data passing between them.

### <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">How it works</mark> 

1. You connect to a website, app, or Wi-Fi network.
2. The attacker positions themselves in the middle.
3. They can:
    
    - **Listen** to sensitive data (passwords, credit cards)
    - **Modify** messages or transaction
    - **Impersonate** one side to the other

## <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> What the attacker actually does </mark>


`Client  ⇄  Attacker  ⇄  Server`

- Client thinks attacker = server
- Server thinks attacker = client
- Attacker relays traffic while observing or modifying it

This is called **bidirectional impersonation**.

Think of it like this:

wire shark is the tool used for man in the middle attack

```terminnal
ipconfiguration
```

if we are not using the secure protocol how the attackers can attack

when we are performing the login

```wireshak
ip equest methord == post
```

open it and we will be able to see the conversation 

how https i encrypting the data

if conninting with the open wifi only use it for simple web searches
