**Defence in depth** just means **using multiple layers of protection instead of relying on one thing**.

In simple terms:  
👉 _<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If one defense fails, another one is there to stop the problem</mark>._

### Everyday example 🏠

Think of protecting your house:

- A **fence**
    
- A **locked door**
    
- An **alarm system**
    
- **Security cameras**
    

If someone gets past the fence, the lock still helps. If the lock fails, the alarm goes off. Each layer adds safety.

### In cybersecurity 💻

It’s the same idea:

- **Firewalls**
- **Strong passwords**
- **Two-factor authentication**
- **Antivirus software**
- **User training**

No single layer is perfect, but together they make attacks much harder.
