**SLE = AV × EF**

- **AV (Asset Value):** What the asset is worth (in money).
    
- **EF (Exposure Factor):** The % of the asset lost in a single incident (expressed as a decimal).
    

**What it tells you:**  
How much money you expect to lose **from one occurrence** of a specific risk.

**Quick example:**

- Asset value (AV) = $100,000
    
- Exposure factor (EF) = 0.25 (25% loss)
    

👉 **SLE = 100,000 × 0.25 = $25,000**

### 📌 Formulas

- **SLE = AV × EF**
    
- **ARO = Annualized Rate of Occurrence**
    
- **ALE = SLE × ARO**
    

### 🧠 What they mean

- **ARO:** How many times you expect the event to happen **per year**
    
- **ALE:** Your **expected yearly loss** from that risk
    

### 💡 Example

- **AV:** $100,000
    
- **EF:** 0.25
    
- **SLE:** $25,000
    
- **ARO:** 0.4 (once every 2.5 years)
    

👉 **ALE = 25,000 × 0.4 = $10,000 per year**

### 🎯 Why this matters

ALE helps you decide whether a control is worth it:

- If a security control costs **$5k/year** and reduces ALE from **$10k → $2k**, it’s a win.
    
- If it costs **$20k/year**, probably not worth it.
    

If you want, I can throw this into a quick table, exam-style summary, or walk through a trickier scenario (like multiple threats to one asset).
