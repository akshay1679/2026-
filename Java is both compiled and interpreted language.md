Java is **both compiled and interpreted**:

- **Compiled** → Java code → bytecode
    
- **Interpreted / JIT-compiled** → bytecode → machine code at runtime
    

Modern JVMs use **JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation**, which:

- Converts frequently used bytecode into **native machine code**
    
- Makes Java performance close to fully compiled languages like C++
    

### So the correct statement is:

> **Java is a hybrid language** — it is **compiled to bytecode** and then **interpreted (or JIT-compiled) by the JVM**.
