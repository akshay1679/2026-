In simple terms:

**JIT privileges** (Just-In-Time privileges) mean **you only get special access _when you actually need it_, and only for a short time**.

### Think of it like this:

Instead of carrying a master key all day 🔑  
You:

- Ask for the key **only when a job requires it**
    
- Use it for a limited time
    
- Then the key is automatically taken back
    

### Why this is useful:

- 🔒 **More secure** – hackers or mistakes have less time to cause damage
    
- ⏱️ **Temporary access** – no permanent “superpowers”
    
- 🧹 **Cleaner permissions** – people don’t keep access they no longer need
    

### Example:

- A developer normally has basic access
    
- They need admin access to fix something
    
- They request **JIT access**
    
- They get admin rights for, say, **30 minutes**
    
- After that, access is removed automatically
    

So, **JIT privileges = “right access, right time, for a short time.”**
