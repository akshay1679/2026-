## 2️⃣ Resource-Based Policies

📌 **Attached directly to a resource**

- The resource decides **who can access it**
- Includes a **Principal** (who is allowed)

**Example idea:**

> “This storage bucket allows User A and Role B to read data.”

🔹 Common in:

- Storage services
- Messaging systems
- APIs 

🧠 Memory trick:  
**Resource-based = the object guards itself**
