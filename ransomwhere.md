## Containing a ransomware attack — simple steps.

Here are **clear, practical points** you can follow when ransomware hits:

1. **Isolate infected systems immediately**
    
    - Disconnect from Wi-Fi, unplug Ethernet, disable Bluetooth.
        
    - Don’t shut down unless encryption is actively spreading.
        
2. **Stop the spread**
    
    - Disable shared drives and network shares.
        
    - Block infected accounts and revoke suspicious credentials.
        
3. **Identify what’s affected**
    
    - List infected machines, servers, and user accounts.
        
    - Note ransom notes, file extensions, and timestamps.
        
4. **Preserve evidence**
    
    - Take screenshots, save logs, keep ransom messages.
        
    - This helps with recovery and legal/insurance needs.
        
5. **Block the malware**
    
    - Quarantine infected devices via endpoint protection.
        
    - Update antivirus/EDR rules across the network.
        
6. **Secure backups**
    
    - Disconnect backup systems so they aren’t encrypted.
        
    - Verify backups are clean before restoring.
        
7. **Patch and close entry points**
    
    - Fix exposed RDP, VPNs, or unpatched software.
        
    - Reset passwords (especially admin accounts).
        
8. **Communicate internally**
    
    - Alert IT, management, and security teams.
        
    - Instruct users **not** to open suspicious files or emails.
        
9. **Do NOT pay the ransom**
    
    - Paying doesn’t guarantee recovery and fuels attacks.
        
    - Explore backups and professional incident response first.
        
10. **Report the incident**
    
    - Inform cyber insurance, legal counsel, and authorities if required.
        

If you want, I can also:

- Turn this into a **one-page incident response checklist**
    
- Simplify it further for **non-technical staff**
    
- Add **real-world examples** of how attacks spread
    

Just say the word.
