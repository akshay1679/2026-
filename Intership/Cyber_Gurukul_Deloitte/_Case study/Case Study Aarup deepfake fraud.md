Early in 2024, an employee of UK engineering firm Arup made a seemingly routine transfer of millions of company dollars, following a<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;"> video call</mark> with senior management.

Except, it turned out, the employee hadn’t been talking to Arup managers at all, but to <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">deepfakes created by artificial intelligence</mark>. The employee had been [tricked into sending $25 million to criminals](https://www.ft.com/content/b977e8d4-664c-4ae4-8a8e-eb93bdf785ea).

This wasn't a traditional cyberattack, the kind that compromises a company’s digital systems. This attack <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">used psychology </mark>and sophisticated deepfake technology to gain the employee’s confidence.

It's an example of how cybercrime is evolving. At the time, Arup’s Chief Information Officer, Rob Greig, said the company had seen the number of cyberattacks rise sharply, along with their sophistication.

This trend is underscored in a World Economic Forum report titled [Unpacking Cyber Resilience](https://www.weforum.org/publications/unpacking-cyber-resilience/), which aims to help companies become more cyber resilient.

Here, Greig – who was previously director of the UK’s Parliamentary Digital Service – talks about what the company learned from its deepfake attack, and what organizations can do to protect themselves.

## 🧠 **How the Attack Worked**

### 1. **Initial Contact via <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Phishing</mark>**

- The fraud began when the targeted finance employee in Arup’s **Hong Kong office** received an email appearing to come from the company’s **Chief Financial Officer (CFO)**.
    
- The email requested help in executing a **“<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">confidential transaction</mark>”** — a classic social-engineering lure.
    

### 2. **Deepfake Video Conference Call**

- The employee<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> joined a video call</mark> that seemed to include the CFO and other senior executives.
    
- However, **every person on that call was a deepfake** — their <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">voices and faces synthetically generated based on AI trained on real recordings</mark>.
    

### 3. **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Trust & Authority Exploited</mark>**

- Because the deepfakes looked and sounded like real colleagues, the employee trusted them and complied with instructions.
    
- The attackers leveraged **technical realism plus human psychology (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">authority, familiarity, urgency</mark>)** to bypass normal skepticism.
    

### 4. **Execution of Transfers**

- The employee authorized **15 wire transfers** totaling about **$25 million**, sending funds to **five separate bank accounts** in Hong Kong.
    
- The fraud wasn’t noticed until the employee later validated the supposed meeting with actual Arup management, who had no knowledge of the transaction.
