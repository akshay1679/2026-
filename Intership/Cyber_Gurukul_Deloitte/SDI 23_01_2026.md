# Class 2 Afternoon
[[Drawing 2026-01-23 06.25.20.excalidraw]]
study the variables in java

```java
public class HelloWorld{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        int x = 20;

        System.out.print("apple");

        System.out.print("cat");

        System.out.println(x);

    }

}
```

```java
public class HelloWorld{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        int k = 20;

        int x = 40;

  

        System.out.println(k);

        System.out.println("good morning"+k+x);

    }

}
```

```output
PS D:\Desktop\java pract> javac HelloWorld.java
PS D:\Desktop\java pract> java HelloWorld.java
20
good morning2040
PS D:\Desktop\java pract> 
```

👆 this is because the java treated it as a string and the concatenates it

args always store the address its a reference variable
datatype is 2 type primitive and non primitive
