remote method invocation

**RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** is a **Java technology** that lets a program **call methods on an object running on another computer** as if it were a local object.

ie: 👉 _Your program can use an object that lives on a different machine over a network._

## Why use RMI?

✅ Makes **distributed systems** easier  
✅ You don’t manually handle sockets or protocols  
✅ Feels like calling normal Java methods
