It usually means a hacker who’s **taking extreme risks**—for example:

- Attacking very powerful organizations
    
- ==Operating without anonymity==
    
- Knowing they’ll likely get caught, sued, or jailed  
    “Suicidal” here is **not literal**; it’s shorthand for _reckless or zero-regard-for-consequences_ behavior.
