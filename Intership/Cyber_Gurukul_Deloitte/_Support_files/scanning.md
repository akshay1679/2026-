filter the information that is required by us and is not required by us
we will be performing de duplication
we could to `ping` to to test whether the system is connected to internet or not

```cmd
ping elm.sa
```

ping packet size maximum size is 65535
 **icmp** protocol
ports available in the system

we are talking about the 
80 http
443 https
most time people are going with the default config
==play with the rules of firewall==

so ports that are unused and un attended ports hackers can utilis them
so close the un attended ports then close them this is called ==hardening==


**What it means:**  
Now the attacker **interacts with the target system** to find weaknesses.

**In simple terms:**  
Like checking which doors and windows of a house are unlocked.

**What happens at a high level:**

- Checking which systems are running
    
- Identifying open ports or services
    
- Looking for known vulnerabilities
    

**Why it matters:**  
This step reveals **possible entry points**.
