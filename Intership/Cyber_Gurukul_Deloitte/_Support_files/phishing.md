creating a fake website 
its a social engineering attack 

Social engineering follows these steps

1. familiarity/liking
2. social census
3. intermediation / authority  --> receiving a message to send money from a higher authority or like a senior
4. scarcity/ urgency  --> eg like only 2 items are left

always used to steal our info and to drop malicious information to the target
