packel that is a software used to attach malitious app with a legitimate system

It sounds like you’re describing a **malware tool**, but the word **“packel”** itself isn’t a standard or widely recognized security term.

Based on your description — _software used to attach a malicious app to a legitimate program_ — you’re probably thinking of one of these 👇

### Most likely terms you mean

**1. Binder**

- A **binder** is malware that **combines (binds)** a malicious payload with a legitimate application.
    
- When the user runs the “normal” app, the **malware runs silently in the background**.
    
- Very common in trojans.
    

**2. Trojan (Trojan Horse)**

- A **trojan** is malware **disguised as legitimate software**.
    
- Users install it willingly, thinking it’s safe.
    
- Often created using binders or droppers.
    

**3. Packer**

- A **packer** compresses or encrypts an executable.
    
- Used **legitimately** to protect software…
    
- …but also used by malware authors to **hide malicious code from antivirus detection**.
    
- A packer alone doesn’t “attach” malware, but it helps **obfuscate** it.
    

**4. Dropper**

- A **dropper** looks like a normal program but **installs malware after execution**.
    
- The malicious code may be downloaded or unpacked at runtime.
    

### Simple definition (what you’re describing)

> Software that attaches a malicious program to a legitimate one is typically called a **binder**, and the resulting malware is classified as a **trojan**.

If you saw the term **“packel”** in a specific article, tool, or class notes, it might be:
