**An insider threat doesn’t always mean “evil intent.”** It just <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">means the risk comes from _inside_ the organization (someone with legitimate access)</mark>. There are **two main types**:

---

### 1. **Malicious insider threat** 😈

This _is_ <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">intentional harm</mark>.

Examples:

- An employee steals data to sell it
    
- A disgruntled worker deletes files on purpose
    
- Someone helps an **APT (Advanced Persistent Threat)** by giving access or credentials
    

👉 **Intent:** Yes, harmful on purpose

---

### 2. **Non-malicious (unintentional) insider threat** 😬


Examples:

- An employee **accidentally deletes important data**
    
- Someone clicks a phishing link, letting an **APT** into the system
    
- Misconfiguring cloud storage and exposing sensitive info
    
- Sending confidential data to the wrong email address
    

👉 **Intent:** <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">No harm intended — but damage still happens</mark>

---

### How this connects to **APT**

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">An **APT** is usually an _external_ attacker, but insiders can:</mark>

- Accidentally help an APT (phishing, weak passwords)
    
- Be tricked or socially engineered
    
- Be coerced or manipulated
    

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">So even if someone **deleted information** or caused data loss **by mistake**, they’re still considered an _insider threat_ because</mark>:

- They had legitimate access
    
- Their action harmed security
    
- Intent doesn’t matter for risk classification

### Simple exam-ready sentence ✅

> _An insider threat does not always have malicious intent; it can occur when a trusted employee accidentally or negligently causes a security incident, such as deleting data or enabling an APT through phishing._
