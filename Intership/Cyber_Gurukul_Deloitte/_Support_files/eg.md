 ```java
class HelloWorld {
	public static void main(String as[])
	{
	System.out.println("hello Java");
	}
}

convention and rule
convention --> non mandatory to follow
rule -> mandatory

class name conventions

1. meaningful name
2. should start with capital letter
3. camel case
4. class name should be noun

`public static void main(String args[])`  --> main method ,entry point compiler


save the file as HelloWorld.java  this is called as the source file if its a public class we can save it also as hello.java

after successful compilation it will create a file called HelloWorld.class 

if class is public file name should be same as the class name else wont compile

`javac hello.java`  --> how to compile the code
