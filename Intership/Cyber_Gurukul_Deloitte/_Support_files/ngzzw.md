`.ngzzw` --> extension
## 🔐 Ransomware / malware indicator (most likely)

- Some ransomware families **append random-looking extensions** (like `.ngzzw`) to files they encrypt.
    
- If your files suddenly changed from something normal (like `photo.jpg`) to `photo.jpg.ngzzw`, that’s a strong red flag.
    
- You’ll often also see a ransom note appear in the same folder.
