hackers always try to collect maximum information 
narrow down the search area
get to know the rules of the firewall

**Goal:**  
<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Collect as much information as possible about a target **without directly interacting** with its systems (mostly passive)</mark>.

**What happens conceptually:**

- Learning _<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">who</mark>_ the target is and _<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">how</mark>_ it operates
    
- Mapping the organization’s <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">digital and physical presence</mark>
    
- <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;"> Identify potential weak points _before_ any technical probing</mark>
    

**Types:**

- **Passive footprinting:**  
    No direct contact with target systems
    
    - Public websites
        
    - Social media
        
    - Job postings
        
    - Public records
        
- **Active footprinting:**  
    Limited interaction
    
    - Contacting employees
        
    - Querying public-facing services
