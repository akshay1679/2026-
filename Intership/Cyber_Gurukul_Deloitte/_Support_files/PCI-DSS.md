**PCI DSS (<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard</mark>)** is a set of security requirements created by Visa, Mastercard, AmEx, Discover, and JCB to protect **cardholder data** and reduce **fraud**.

### What PCI DSS is meant to protect

- **Cardholder data**: card number (PAN), expiry date, cardholder name
- **Sensitive authentication data**: CVV/CVC, PINs (this must _never_ be stored)
