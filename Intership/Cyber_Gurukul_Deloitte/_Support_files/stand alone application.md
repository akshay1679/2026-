A **stand-alone application** is a software program that **runs on its own**—it doesn’t need a constant internet connection, a web browser, or another main system to function.
in simple words : If you can **install it and open it directly on your device**, and it mostly works by itself, it’s a stand-alone app.

eg : 
- Microsoft Word
    
- Adobe Photoshop
    
- VLC Media Player
