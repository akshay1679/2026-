## What is agentic AI?

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems that don’t just respond to prompts, but **act as agents**: they can plan, make decisions, take actions, and adapt over time to achieve goals—often <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">with minimal human supervision</mark>.

Think of the shift like this:

    
- **Agentic AI** → <mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">_figures out what to do next_ and does it</mark>
    

### Core traits of agentic AI

An agentic system typically has several of these:

1. **Goal-oriented behavior**  
    It’s given an objective (e.g., “optimize cloud costs” or “book my travel”) and works toward it.
    
2. **Planning & reasoning**  
    Breaks big goals into steps, evaluates options, revises plans when things change.
    
3. **Tool use & action**  
    Can call APIs, write code, send emails, browse files, trigger workflows, etc.
    
4. **Memory**  
    Remembers past actions, context, preferences, or failures to improve future behavior.
    
5. **Autonomy (to a degree)**  
    Operates without constant prompts—sometimes running in loops until the task is done.
    


### Real-world use cases

- 🤖 **AI software engineers** (code, test, debug, deploy)
    
- 📈 **Autonomous data analysts**
    
- 🧑‍💼 **Personal assistants** that manage calendars, email, travel
    
- 🛒 **E-commerce agents** optimizing pricing and inventory
    
- 🧠 **Research agents** that read papers and synthesize findings
    

### How it’s usually built

Agentic AI often combines:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
    
- Planning frameworks (task decomposition, tree search)
    
- Tool execution layers
    
- Memory systems (vector DBs, logs)
    
- Guardrails & human-in-the-loop controls
