it is just like a structued 

li lead implementer --> protect sensitive information
reduce security risk
comply with legal and regulatory 
along with that we will be able t improv all the security posture


So by following this iso we will be able to reduce almost all the attack surfaces

1. So the first thing we are going to <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">define the scope</mark>
2. going to conduct <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">risk assesment</mark>
3. define and develop the policies and procedures
4. implement the controls
5. train the employees 
6. Monitor and review


### Define the scope

- servers
- application
- system
- data (customer data, employee data)
- data stored in office or onsite ,offsite(data center), clouds

### Risk assessment

- how much loss our organization has to face is the data is 
- identify risk, threats, vulnerability
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">what could go wrong ? </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">How likely it is ? </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">What will be the impact ? </mark>
- what sort of risk --> weak password
- what sort of threat -->brute force attack
- what sort of impact --> unauthorized access

[[calculation for risk assesment]]


## Define and Develop the Policies and Procedures

common policies we are following
1. access control policy --> how to define the privilages
2. information security policy  --> cerate a structured map when and how to respond when an emergency or an incident occurs
3. incident response policy
4. [[Password Policy]]  also contain [[Password Expiry]]

access controls types --> rule based access control ,least privilege, zero trust

### Implement The Controls

on the basis of what ever the policies and procedures we are able to control we will be able to make control

Security Functional Types

* [[Preventive control]]
* Detective control
* Corrective control
* Directive control
* [[ Deterrent control]]
* Compensating control

## Train The Employees 

- Security trainings are mandatory for everyone
- Phishing awareness training

these are called the typos

in a gmail / google when we hover the mouse over the link the full link will be shown in the bottom of the page

get link for the game then search it on virus total and then install it

## Monitor and review



PDCA -iso 27001 is gonna follow the improvement with the help of this approach

plan 
do
check
act

## PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Act).

PDCA is a **continuous improvement cycle** that ISO/IEC 27001 uses to make sure an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** doesn’t just exist, but keeps getting better over time.

Here’s what each part means **in the context of ISO 27001** 👇

### **1. Plan**

Set up the ISMS and decide _what_ you’re going to do.

- Define the **scope** of the ISMS
    
- Identify **information security risks**
    
- Perform **risk assessment & risk treatment**
    
- Establish **security objectives**
    
- Select appropriate **controls** (Annex A)
    
- Create policies, procedures, and plans
    

👉 Goal: _Figure out the risks and plan how to manage them._

---

### **2. Do**

Put the plan into action.

- Implement the selected **security controls**
    
- Run procedures and policies
    
- Train employees
    
- Operate the ISMS in day-to-day activities
    
- Apply risk treatment plans
    

👉 Goal: _Actually do what you planned._

---

### **3. Check**

Measure and evaluate performance.

- Monitor and measure controls
    
- Conduct **internal audits**
    
- Review incidents and nonconformities
    
- Check if security objectives are being met
    
- Perform **management review**
    

👉 Goal: _See if the ISMS is working as intended._

---

### **4. Act**

Improve and fix what’s not working.

- Take **corrective actions**
    
- Address audit findings
    
- Update risk assessments
    
- Improve controls and processes
    
- Enhance ISMS effectiveness
    

👉 Goal: _Continually improve information security._

---

### **In one line**

**PDCA ensures ISO 27001 is not a one-time project but a continuous improvement process.**

## **CIS CSC** stands for **Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls**.

it is the min among of security our organization needs to have to keep it safe

cis benchmark
and cis will perform the scan and checks for the cis will provide a practical check list to keep the cyber security and also make the system with no budget

1. cis control
2. [[Inventory and Control of Software Assets]]
3.  [[Data Protection]]
4. [[Secure Configuration of Enterprise Assets and Software]]
5. [[Account Management]]
6. [[Access Control Management]]
7. [[Continuous Vulnerability Management]]
8. [[Audit Log Management]]
