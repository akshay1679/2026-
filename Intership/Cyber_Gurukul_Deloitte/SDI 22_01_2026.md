scale up and scale down the application --> so how to scale up fire wall similarly how to scale up a the app sec

- [ ] study java

most all of enterprise application run on java

==what is java== 
java is not only prog lang --> 
java was developed bic thy want to dev an app which would run in any devices

### History of java

Here’s a **brief history of Java**, clean and to the point 👇

- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1991</mark>** – Java was first created at **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Sun Microsystems</mark>** by James Gosling and his team.
    
    - Original name: **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Oak</mark>** (named after an oak tree outside Gosling’s office).
        
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1995</mark>** – Oak was renamed **Java** because “Oak” was already trademarked.
    
    - Java was officially launched to the public.
        
    - Key idea: **“<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)</mark>**.
        
- **Mid-<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1990s</mark>** – Java <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">became popular through</mark> **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Java Applets</mark>**, which ran inside web browsers.
    
- **Late <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1990s – 2000s</mark>** – Java expanded beyond browsers into:
    
    - Desktop applications
        
    - Enterprise systems (Java EE)
        
    - Mobile devices (early Android later used Java-based languages)
        
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">2010</mark>** – **<mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">Oracle</mark>** <mark style="background: #D2B3FFA6;">acquired Sun Microsystems</mark>.
    
    - Java ownership transferred to Oracle.
        

What is a [[stand alone application]] ?



what is diff bet user variable and system variable in windows ?
- [[user variable vs system variable]]

What is diff bet compiler and runtime version ?

Why the difference matters

- You can **compile with a newer compiler** but run on an **older runtime** → might crash or refuse to start.
    
- You can **compile with an older compiler** and run on a **newer runtime** → usually fine.
    

Example (Java):

`Compiled with Java 17 Run on Java 11 → ❌ Unsupported class version Compiled with Java 11 Run on Java 17 → ✅ Works`
vertion miss match how / version conflict how to fix

### Feature of java

1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">simple</mark> --> memory is auto allocated (no memory leakage) auto allocation means no memory leakage, [[garbage collector]]  
2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">obj oriented</mark> -->reusability , inside object oriented programming there is data security. [[OOP]]
3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">architectural neutral</mark> --> java prog --> compile --> byte code --> interpreted by interpreter JVM --> machine code  [[eg]]
4. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">secure</mark> -->due to scope of variable, java is mostly used in network environment a lot of emphasis has been paced on security , java application is virus free no body can tamper the application once if anyone is going to tamper the byte code we cannot run the byte code

[[byte code running in java]]

5. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">portable</mark> : its diff from architectural neutral ie if i have written the code on windows machine (32 bit) and i run on Linux with (64 bit) the basic datatype will have a fixed size
6. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">distributed</mark>: [[RMI]] 
7. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Robust</mark>: java API are designed in java only so handling the bug is much easier
8. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">multithread</mark>: **Multithreading** is a way for a program to do **multiple things at the same time** by splitting work into smaller units called **threads**. ==what is diff bet multi tasking and multi threading==
9. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interpreted</mark> : [[Java is both compiled and interpreted language]]
10. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high performance</mark>
11. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">applet programing</mark> : makes java enable for web applications
structured approach eg cpp
oop approach eg java
