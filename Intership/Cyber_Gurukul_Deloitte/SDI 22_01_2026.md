- [ ] study java
- [ ] eclipse java
most all of enterprise application run on java

==what is java== 
java is not only prog lang --> 
java was developed bic thy want to dev an app which would run in any devices

### History of java

Here’s a **brief history of Java**, clean and to the point 👇

- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1991</mark>** – Java was first created at **Sun Microsystems** by James Gosling and his team.
    
    - Original name: **Oak** (named after an oak tree outside Gosling’s office).
        
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1995</mark>** – Oak was renamed **Java** because “Oak” was already trademarked.
    
    - Java was officially launched to the public.
        
    - Key idea: **“Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA)**.
        
- **Mid-<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1990s</mark>** – Java became popular through **Java Applets**, which ran inside web browsers.
    
- **Late <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">1990s – 2000s</mark>** – Java expanded beyond browsers into:
    
    - Desktop applications
        
    - Enterprise systems (Java EE)
        
    - Mobile devices (early Android later used Java-based languages)
        
- **<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">2010</mark>** – **Oracle** acquired Sun Microsystems.
    
    - Java ownership transferred to Oracle.

### Feature of java

1. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">simple</mark> --> memory is auto allocated (no memory leakage) auto allocation means no memory leakage, [[garbage collector]]  
2. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">obj oriented</mark> -->reusability , inside object oriented programming there is data security. [[OOP]]
3. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">architectural neutral</mark> --> java prog --> compile --> byte code --> interpreted by interpreter JVM --> machine code  [[eg]]
4. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">secure</mark> -->due to scope of variable, java is mostly used in network environment a lot of emphasis has been paced on security , java application is virus free no body can tamper the application once if anyone is going to tamper the byte code we cannot run the byte code

[[byte code running in java]]

5. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">portable</mark> : its diff from architectural neutral ie if i have written the code on windows machine (32 bit) and i run on Linux with (64 bit) the basic datatype will have a fixed size
6. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">distributed</mark>: [[RMI]] i
7. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Robust</mark>: java API are designed in java only so handling the bug is much easier
8. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">multithread</mark>: every application is ==what is diff bet multi tasking and multi threading==
9. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">interpreted</mark>
10. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">high performance</mark>
11. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">applet programing</mark> : makes java enable for web applications
structured approach eg cpp
oop approach eg java
