first step in any data science
where you  understand the data before building models.


You **explore**, **clean**, and **visualize** the data to answer:

1. What does the data contain?
    
2. Is the data clean or messy?
    
3. Are there missing values?
    
4. How are values distributed?
    
5. Are there patterns or outliers?
