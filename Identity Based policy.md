## 1️⃣ Identity-Based Policies

📌 **Attached to identities** (users, groups, roles)

- Says **what actions an identity is allowed or denied**
- Most common type

**Example idea:**

> “User Akshay can read files from S3, but cannot delete them.”

🔹 Used with:
- Users
- Groups    
- Roles

**Identity-based = permissions travel with the user**
